# assemblevimrc 
Simple node.js script for managing a (or multiple, really) `.vimrc` 
configuration files.

## Configuration
Check out the `config.json` file. This is MY configuration - it's what I use
for my own vim editor. You're encouraged to modify it however you'd like to.

## Usage
Simply run the following command in a terminal:
```
node assemblevimrc.js min
```
